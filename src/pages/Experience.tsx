      <p>
        <strong>LUNARA - Resource Library Service Developer</strong><br />
        LUNARA is an app for Doulas, a compassionate digital sanctuary connecting postpartum mothers with certified Doulas and support specialists during their fourth trimester journey. I am developing the Resource Library Service that powers 35â€“40% of LUNARA's core architecture. Also implementing a unified content management framework with role-based access, ML-driven personalization, and enterprise-grade search and CDN integration. The systems optimize scalability, reduce technical debt, and deliver a performant foundation for content operations.
